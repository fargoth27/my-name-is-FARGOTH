Yaacov Agam is one op artist of whom I have taken a look at. He was born on the 11th of May, 1928 in Palestine with 
an Israeli citizenship.

This photo right here is depicting one of the pieces of work that Yaacov Agam has done on the side of a building. I am not saying that the piece of art is blatantly aesthetically unappealing, as the cohesion of the colors is not arbitrary and there is some sort of gradient effect-- I am only now wondering what is making it to be considered OP art. Maybe my eyes are not so susceptible to these optical illusions as someone else is, as I am not really noticing any fuzziness or movement.

This is picture which is more blatantly OP art and it would hard for it to be argued as anything else. There is an arrangement of colors and patterns that are supposed to, in theory, have som effect on your vision. However, while in this case I do recognize that someone may be under an optical trick while they are viewing it, I am personally not effected in the slightest by it and it looks to me to be just a static image.

Reginald H. Neal was an op artist (1909 - 1992) He resided in the USA.

This is a picture that when I look at it I am actually understand the fuzzy effect that is intended. This is the first picture in this assignment's text that has some sort of optical effect on me. It seems like it could be that the squares are as an
image being distorted by intense heart in a desert, like a mirage.

It is a similar style that is prevalent throughout all of his artwork. His art is consistently able to make my perception of the art feel fuzzy, in a way that feels similar to each piece. 

Ludwig Wilding (19 May 1927 â€“ 4 January 2010). He was born in Grunstadt Germany and towards the end of his life had residence in the United States.

The art here is the first in this assignment's text that is depicting something of geometry. I get the effect that this is a material, thing and flexible, with a spherical object pushing out from under it.

The art here is in my opinion more interesting that the depicted art. The square cubic object being portrayed is actually giving the effect that it is maybe posessing some round qualities, despite, if you notice, all of the edges being a complete parrallel to eachother.
